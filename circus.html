			<h3>HOW TO JUGGLE</h3>
			<p>Juggling is a skill that is a little bit difficult to learn. Juggling involves hand-eye co-ordination in order for it to look effortless. Here is how you can teach your self to juggle;</p>
			<ul class="list-group" id="instructions">
				<li class="list-group-item">Assume the position to juggle: stand with your shoulders in line with your feet and your elbows bent at 90 degrees.  Not too bent, though, or it will become uncomfortable</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Start with one ball. Throwing it back and forth between each hand, make sure your throws are consistent in a gentle arc, and go above eye level. <b>TIP start juggling with beanbags or something that won’t roll away when you drop them on the floor</b>.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Start practicing with one ball with your eyes closed. Keep practicing until you can consistently throw one ball in an arch at the same height and the same speed. Remember… Practice makes perfect.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Add another juggling ball into the mix. With one ball in each hand, throw them as before. However, when the first ball peaks, throw the second ball underneath to land in your other hand. Once again. the key to this and every step is practice, practice, practice.   Don’t move onto step 5 until you have mastered this.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item"> Now it’s time to put a third juggling ball into the mix. Place two juggling balls in your dominant hand and one in the other hand. Throw the juggling balls just as before, but add a third throw right before the second juggling ball comes down. Keep practicing until you can make 5 throws and 5 catches.</li>
			</ul>
